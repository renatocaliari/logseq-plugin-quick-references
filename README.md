# Context

This plugin came out of my need doing [interstitial-journaling](https://nesslabs.com/interstitial-journaling) and refering my current project on this week or tags more used.
I'd like to avoid to type those things every time I changed the focus and subject on my journal, e.g. life/project/ABC or life/health/emotions, etc.

# Using 
So I thought that I could have a quick slash command or shortcut.
Initially I did 3 slash commands to each of my most important things to the moment:
- /1 Quick Reference
- /2 Quick Reference
- /3 Quick Reference

Each command get the related reference from the page "Contents" under some block named "Quick References".
All you need is to create something like that in the Contents page:

- Quick Reference
  - [[my most used page on this week]]
  - #[[my-special-tag]]
  - anything else

Note the 3 lines under "Quick Reference". Each one corresponding to each slash command at the same order: /1 Quick Reference, /2 Quick Reference and /3 Quick Reference.

So, when you are typing and want to mention some page set in the Contents, you just need to use those commands.
It allowed me easily to change the references when needed.
